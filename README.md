# Spam Classifier using Naive Bayes

This project implements a **Spam Detection System** using the **Naive Bayes** classification algorithm. The model is trained to classify messages as either *spam* or *ham* (not spam) based on their textual content.

## Overview

The notebook walks through the full machine learning pipeline:

1. **Data Loading**
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
4. **Feature Extraction using TF-IDF**
5. **Model Building with Multinomial Naive Bayes**
6. **Model Evaluation**
7. **Testing with Sample Inputs**

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* NLTK
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook
